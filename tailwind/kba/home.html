            <p>The “Developer Essentials for Blockchain” course is designed as a bridge for individuals with fundamental programming knowledge who plan to develop applications in the blockchain space. The course aims to help learners understand the integrated working of various technologies commonly used in blockchain development, including front-end development, back-end development, databases, containers, and Git. By building a simple Hello World application using React, Express, MongoDB, Docker, and Git, participants will gain practical experience and a solid foundation to explore DApp (Decentralized Application) development further. This course provides a condensed overview of DApp development rather than delving into intricate discussions about specific technologies. It aims to cover a range of topics that enable a seamless entry into the world of DApp development.</p>
